Regression analysis
Regression is a technique for investigating the relationship between the independent variable(s) or features and a dependent variable(s) or target.
It is used as a method for predictive modeling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes.

The equation to denote the linear regression model:
y=a+b*x

Machine Learning models
A machine learning model is an expression of an algorithm that analyses data, 
finds patterns or makes predictions. Fueled by data, machine learning models are 
the mathematical engines of artificial intelligence.

Building an ML model
When we are building a machine learning model we usually take standard steps.

problem formulation
data tidying
preprocessing
train-test-split
model building
model validation and fine-tuning
prediction
